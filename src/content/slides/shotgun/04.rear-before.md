The shelves in the corner of the second bedroom smelled like soil due to how
many cat’s claw vines had burrowed into this part of the house.

The original bathroom was old and neglected, and suffered from severe water
damage and rot.

The kitchen had a door in the corner that led to the side yard, and being next to the stove, it was covered in decades of grease.

The sagging popcorn ceilings in the kitchen were a symptom of a greater illnesss to be uncovered during demolition.
